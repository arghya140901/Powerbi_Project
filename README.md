ðŸš€ Check out my Power BI Super Store Sales Dashboard! ðŸ“Š
Iâ€™ve created an end-to-end project in Power BI, covering everything from data import and cleaning to designing interactive dashboards. Here are the highlights:
1.Data Import and Cleaning: I mastered the art of importing and cleaning data, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
2.Dashboard Design: My dashboard features advanced charts, maps, and slicers for an intuitive user experience.
3.Sales Forecasting: Leveraging Power BI, I forecasted sales trends, helping businesses make informed decisions.
4.Export to PDF: The dashboard can be exported as a PDF for easy sharing and presentation.
5.Project Insights: Along the way, I gained valuable insights into sales patterns and customer behavior.
Feel free to explore the dashboard and let me know your thoughts! ðŸ“ˆðŸ‘‡
